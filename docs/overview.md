# Overview

Discover **DroneDB in less than 2 minutes**.

## What is DroneDB

A set of tools to verify, manage and share aerial data.

*![Summary](./assets/summary.svg)*

We will soon allow for processing of data. In the meanwhile, [WebODM](https://opendronemap.org/webodm/) can help you with that.

## Better Tools

### For Verification

You just came back from a morning of drone flying. You captured lots of data. **Great!** Is your data correct?

*What you know:*
 - The thumbnails look correct:

![explorer](./assets/brighton-explorer.png)

*What you don't know:*
 - Are the images georeferenced correctly (or at all)?
 - Did you miss to capture an image (or an entire section)?

DroneDB Desktop can help:

That's insightful!

Now you're ready to copy/move your images (or a subset of them) and send them to your favorite program for further processing/analysis.

You can use this tool to sort through your datasets more quickly or to examine your SD cards.

### For Sharing

You have lots of data:
 - Images
 - Videos
 - Orthophotos
 - Elevation Models
 - Point Clouds
 - 3D Models
 - Panoramas
 - Supporting files (PDFs, etc.)

*Where* do you put your files so others can access them?

Google Drive? Dropbox? OneDrive? iCloud?

But your assets look so sad on these :( You can't interact with them until you've downloaded all of them.

[DroneDB Hub](https://hub.dronedb.app) (which you can self-host via Registry or Server) can help:

![Hub 1](./assets/hub-1.png)
![Hub 2](./assets/hub-2.png)

Hub is interactive; you can view images, point clouds, textured models, panoramas all in one place (and still download the raw files).

## Get Started
